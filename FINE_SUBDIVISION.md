# Edge-Based Mesh Refinement Plan

## Problem
Current mesh generation has issues with sharp features and curved surfaces:
- Initial triangulation follows octree faces, missing diagonal features
- Vertex optimization alone can't capture sharp edges well
- Need better adaptation to surface curvature

## Solution: Edge-Based Adaptive Refinement

### Core Insight
Instead of face-based subdivision, we use edges as the primary refinement primitive:
- Edges are the natural unit in half-edge mesh representation
- Edge midpoint SDF evaluation directly measures geometric error
- Splitting edges maintains mesh consistency naturally
- Avoids complex face subdivision patterns

### Status: Implementation Complete ✓

Core mesh refinement features are now implemented:

1. Edge Quality Analysis ✓
   - Midpoint evaluation
   - Error metrics
   - Priority queue tracking

2. Edge-Based Refinement ✓
   - Edge splitting
   - Face updates
   - Half-edge maintenance
   - Vertex optimization

3. Implementation Features ✓
   - Edge quality tracking
   - Splitting methods
   - Optimization
   - Configuration options
   - Progress tracking

4. Visualization TODO:
   - Edge quality heat map
   - Split highlighting
   - Progress display

### Benefits
- Natural fit with half-edge data structure
- Simpler implementation than face subdivision
- Better handling of sharp features
- More uniform refinement based on actual geometry
- Maintains mesh consistency automatically

## Success Metrics
- Reduced maximum SDF error along edges
- Better approximation of sharp features
- Controlled and localized refinement
- Manifold mesh preservation
