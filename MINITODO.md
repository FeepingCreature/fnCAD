- [x] `-1` as number literal. test.
- [] should allow sizes other than 3, check for 3-size vector when *needed*.
  3-size numeric vector is just a special case of array. tests for this.
- `module foo(a)` should be callable with `foo(2)`, not just `foo(a=2)`.
- To be safe, add test for named parameters out of order.
