# OpenSCAD-like Syntax Implementation

## 1. Core Language Features
- [ ] Basic primitives that lower to SDFs:
  - [ ] cube
  - [ ] sphere
  - [ ] cylinder
  - [ ] polyhedron
- [ ] Boolean operations:
  - [ ] union
  - [ ] difference
  - [ ] intersection
- [ ] Transformations:
  - [ ] translate
  - [ ] rotate
  - [ ] scale
  - [ ] mirror
  - [ ] multmatrix

## 2. Language Improvements
- [ ] First-class functions
- [ ] Let bindings
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] Type system
- [ ] Modules as proper functions
- [ ] Named arguments with defaults
- [ ] Better error messages

## 3. Control Flow
- [ ] for loops with proper iteration
- [ ] if/else as expressions
- [ ] list comprehensions
- [ ] map/reduce/filter

## 4. Data Structures
- [ ] Proper lists/arrays
- [ ] Records/structs
- [ ] Optional types
- [ ] Custom types

## 5. SDF Integration
- [ ] All primitives implemented as clean SDFs
- [ ] Boolean ops preserve SDF properties
- [ ] Transformations maintain distance field
- [ ] Custom SDF function escape hatch
- [ ] Smooth unions and other SDF-specific operations

## 6. Tooling
- [ ] Syntax highlighting
- [ ] Code completion
- [ ] Documentation generation
- [ ] Import/export system
- [ ] Package management

## 7. OpenSCAD Compatibility
- [ ] Import existing OpenSCAD files
- [ ] Compatibility layer for common idioms
- [ ] Migration guide
- [ ] Common pattern translations

## 8. Advanced Features
- [ ] Named anchors and attachment points
- [ ] Parametric designs
- [ ] Library system
- [ ] Meta-programming capabilities
- [ ] Debug visualization tools
